# Quick start
To try the calculator at once, you should download *Calculator.exe* from the release. All files are created in the *Program Files (x86)* folder named *Calculator*.

# Calculator source code
If you are interested in the project code, it is located in the *Calculator source code* folder. You can just run the *Calculator.sln* file and the project will open in Visual Studio and we can run the code immediately.
